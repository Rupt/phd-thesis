(1) Insist on doing everything through ``channels.'' Never permit short-cuts

experiences. Never hesitate to make a few appropriate ``patriotic'' comments.

``reasonable'' and avoid haste which might result in embarrassments or
difficulties later on.\\\\
(8) Be worried about the propriety of any decision --- raise the question of
whether such action as is contemplated lies within the jurisdiction of the
group or whether it might conflict with the policy of some higher echelon.%

\epigraph{%
Inference is not an automatic procedure.
The universe has no mechanism for telling us ``objective'' truth.
We have to actively seek answers for ourselves.
That's how inference actually is.
It's no use complaining about it, or trying to evade it.
We must live with it, whether we like it or not.
As it happens, I do like it.%

## pratt
Within this theory, statistical methods of great practical usefulness have been
developed, and its statements can and frequently do contribute in a vague way
to the interpretation of data.

\ldots But this book, by its very excellence, its thoroughness, lucidity and
precision, intensifies my growing feeling that nevertheless the theory is
arbitrary, be it however ``objective,'' and the problems it solves, however
precisely it may solve them, are not even simplified theoretical counterparts
of the real problems to which it is applied.


## on bullshit
The bullshitter is faking things. But this does not mean that he
necessarily gets them wrong.

The notion of carefully wrought bullshit involves, then, a
certain inner strain.

Both interpret the ratio as a probability

CL confusion began earlier ~ 1984

coincide with thoseobtained from the Bayesian method in two important cases:

% Footnote to describe the ATLAS coordinate system

The following footnote should be used in every ATLAS publication to describe the ATLAS coordinate system.

\footnote{%
ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal
interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the $z$-axis along the
beam pipe.
The $x$-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the $y$-axis
points upward.
Cylindrical coordinates $(r,\phi)$ are used in the transverse plane, $\phi$
being the azimuthal angle around the $z$-axis.
The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle $\theta$ as
$\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)$.%

The ATLAS detector~\cite{PERF-2007-01} is a multipurpose particle detector with a forward--backward symmetric cylindrical geometry and a near \(4\pi\) coverage in solid angle.\footnote{
ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the \(z\)-axis along the beam pipe.
The \(x\)-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the \(y\)-axis points upwards.
Cylindrical coordinates \((r,\phi)\) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the \(z\)-axis.
The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) as \(\eta = -\ln \tan(\theta/2)\).
Angular distance is measured in units of \(\Delta R \equiv \sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2} + (\Delta\phi)^{2}}\).}  %% end footnote
It consists of an inner tracking detector surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid providing a \SI{2}{\tesla} axial magnetic field, electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer.
The inner tracking detector covers the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta| < 2.5\).
It consists of silicon pixel, silicon microstrip, and transition radiation tracking detectors.
An additional layer of silicon pixels, the  insertable B-layer~\cite{ATLAS-TDR-19,PIX-2018-001}, was installed before Run~2.
Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters provide electromagnetic (EM) energy measurements with high granularity.
A steel/scintillator-tile hadron calorimeter covers the central pseudorapidity range (\(|\eta| < 1.7\)).
The endcap and forward regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both the EM and hadronic energy measurements up to \(|\eta| = 4.9\).
The muon spectrometer surrounds the calorimeters and is based on three large superconducting air-core toroidal magnets with eight coils each.
The field integral of the toroids ranges between \num{2.0} and \SI{6.0}{\tesla\metre} across most of the detector.
The muon spectrometer includes a system of precision chambers for tracking and fast detectors for triggering.
A two-level trigger system is used to select events.
The first-level trigger is implemented in hardware and uses a subset of the detector information to accept events at a rate below \SI{100}{\kHz}.
This is followed by a software-based trigger that reduces the accepted event rate to \SI{1}{\kHz} on average depending on the data-taking conditions.
An extensive software suite~\cite{ATL-SOFT-PUB-2021-001} is used in the reconstruction and analysis of real and simulated data, in detector operations, and in the trigger and data acquisition systems of the experiment.
