Towards explaining the main result of this thesis,
a search for effects from supersymmetric models in
\atlas~\cite{atlas2022searches},
we first some relevant facts about the \atlas\ detector ---
its design and history.

The \atlas\ detector was not delivered in a preordained form.
It was designed with intent to provide maximally useful and novel data within
real-world cost budgets.
Original designs hoped to construct an \atlas\ detector that could
observe the Higgs boson (which was predicted but yet unseen),
precisely measure known massive objects ($W$, $Z$, and $t$),
and possibly discover new particles such as those hypothesized by
supersymmetric models~\cite{atlas1999design1}.
We now review these three goals with the subsequent news from \atlas'
operations.

\paragraph{Higgs boson discovery.}
Prior to \atlas' construction, the Higgs boson mass (and existence) was
poorly known, but loosely constrained by results like
$m_H \gtrsim 90\,\eV[G]$ from searches at the
Large Electronâ€“Positron Collider (LEP),
$m_H = 76^{+85}_{-47}\,\eV[G]$ from other data on the electroweak sector,
and $m_H \lesssim 1\,\eV[T]$ from theoretical unitarity arguments~\cite{
atlas1999design2,
ghinculov1998perturb,
lep1999ewk
}.
The Higgs boson couples to an extraordinary variety of fundamental particles.
For its discovery alone, \atlas' designers achieved sensitivity across the
entire $100$ to $1000\,\eV[G]$ window by targetting decays including
$H\to b\bar b$,
$H\to \gamma\gamma$,
$H\to ZZ^* \to 4\ell$, and
$H\to ZZ \to \ell\ell\nu\nu$;
these channels demand precise measurements of leptons, photons, and
$b$-jets, as well as sensitivity to the missing transverse momentum of
invisible neutrinos for $ZZ \to \ell\ell\nu\nu$ decays at the very highest
masses.

Both \atlas\ and \cms\ have now found a Higgs boson candidate at
$m_H = 125\,\eV[G]$~\cite{
atlas2012higgs,
atlas2012combined,
cms2012higgs
}
and confirmed all of its tested Standard Model properties~\cite{
combined2016higgs,
atlas2022ten,
cms2022ten
}.

\paragraph{Measurement of known massive objects.}
Other than the Higgs boson, the heavy Standard Model resonances are the
$W$ and $Z$ bosons and the top quark, all of which are produced at
high rates by LHC proton-proton collisions.

The goal of measuring these heavy objects puts more emphasis on determining
the total energy of hadronic jets than their precise hadronic compositions.

identification of the \lhcb\ detector makes it more competitive for hadronic
physics.?}

\paragraph{Supersymmetry discovery.}
This is not a failure. It is a success.
Our goal is not to discover something that is not there, but to learn more
about nature.
The nonappearance of supersymmetric particles at the LHC is itself a discovery.


\paragraph{Design.}
Atlas is a Titan.
On the \cern\ Large Hadron Collider (LHC), \atlas\ is the largest detector
experiment, and alongside its majors neighbours
\cms~\cite{cms2008experiment},
\lhcb~\cite{lhcb2008experiment},
and ALICE~\cite{alice2008experiment}
it is a multi-kilotonne beast,
and a wonder of scientific engineering~\cite{
atlas2008experiment,
atlas1999design1,
atlas1999design2
}.

Our search paper~\cite{atlas2022searches} contains concise and standard
descriptions of the \atlas\ detector and its relevant components.
Through its many inexact reproductions in past \atlas\ publications, the text
of these descriptions has become so highly refined that my attempts to improve
upon it would be in vain.
Instead, this section quotes our published text with explanatory commentary.

\begin{displayquote}
``%
The ATLAS detector~\cite{PERF-2007-01} is a multipurpose particle detector with
a forward--backward symmetric cylindrical geometry and a near $4\pi$ coverage
in solid angle.%
\footnote{%
``ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal
interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the $z$-axis along the
beam pipe.
The $x$-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the $y$-axis
points upwards.
Cylindrical coordinates $(r,\phi)$ are used in the transverse plane, $\phi$
being the azimuthal angle around the $z$-axis.
The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle $\theta$ as
$\eta = -\ln \tan(\theta/2)$.
Angular distance is measured in units of
$\Delta R \equiv \sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2} + (\Delta\phi)^{2}}$.%

solenoid providing a $2\,\mathrm{T}$ axial magnetic field, electromagnetic and
hadronic calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer.%

the EM and hadronic energy measurements up to $|\eta| = 4.9$.%

The muon spectrometer surrounds the calorimeters and is based on three large
superconducting air-core toroidal magnets with eight coils each.

This is followed by a software-based trigger that reduces the accepted event
rate to $1\,\mathrm{kHz}$ on average depending on the data-taking conditions.%
