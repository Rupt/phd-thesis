Towards explaining the main result of this thesis,
a search for effects from supersymmetric models in
\atlas~\cite{atlas2022searches},
we first some relevant facts about the \atlas\ detector itself.

\atlas\ is a Titan.
On the \cern\ Large Hadron Collider (LHC), \atlas\ is the largest detector
experiment, and alongside its majors neighbours
\cms~\cite{cms2008experiment},
\lhcb~\cite{lhcb2008experiment},
and ALICE~\cite{alice2008experiment}
it is a multi-kilotonne beast,
and a wonder of scientific engineering~\cite{
atlas2008experiment,
atlas1999design1,
atlas1999design2
}.

Our search paper~\cite{atlas2022searches} contains concise and standard
descriptions of the \atlas\ detector and its relevant components.
Through its many inexact reproductions in past \atlas\ publications, the text
of these descriptions has become so highly refined that my attempts to improve
upon it would be in vain.
Instead, this section quotes our published text with explanatory commentary.

\begin{displayquote}
``%
The ATLAS detector~\cite{PERF-2007-01} is a multipurpose particle detector with
a forward--backward symmetric cylindrical geometry and a near $4\pi$ coverage
in solid angle.%
\footnote{%
``ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal
interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the $z$-axis along the
beam pipe.
The $x$-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the $y$-axis
points upwards.
Cylindrical coordinates $(r,\phi)$ are used in the transverse plane, $\phi$
being the azimuthal angle around the $z$-axis.
The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle $\theta$ as
$\eta = -\ln \tan(\theta/2)$.
Angular distance is measured in units of
$\Delta R \equiv \sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2} + (\Delta\phi)^{2}}$.%
''~\cite{atlas2022searches}
}
It consists of an inner tracking detector surrounded by a thin superconducting
solenoid providing a $2\,\mathrm{T}$ axial magnetic field, electromagnetic and
hadronic calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer.%
''~\cite{atlas2022searches}
\end{displayquote}


\subsection{Inner tracker}
\label{sec:atlas_tracker}
\TODO{inner tracker}
\begin{displayquote}
``%
The inner tracking detector covers the pseudorapidity range $|\eta| < 2.5$.
It consists of silicon pixel, silicon microstrip, and transition radiation
tracking detectors.
An additional layer of silicon pixels, the insertable
B-layer~\cite{ATLAS-TDR-19, PIX-2018-001}, was installed before Run~2.%
''~\cite{atlas2022searches}
\end{displayquote}


\subsection{Calorimeters}
\label{sec:atlas_calo}
\TODO{calo}
\begin{displayquote}
``%
Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters provide electromagnetic (EM)
energy measurements with high granularity.
A steel/scintillator-tile hadron calorimeter covers the central pseudorapidity
range ($|\eta| < 1.7$).
The endcap and forward regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both
the EM and hadronic energy measurements up to $|\eta| = 4.9$.%
''~\cite{atlas2022searches}
\end{displayquote}

The `A' in \atlas\ does not stand for Argon, but perhaps it should.


\subsection{Muon system}
\label{sec:atlas_muon}
\TODO{muon system}
\begin{displayquote}
``%
The muon spectrometer surrounds the calorimeters and is based on three large
superconducting air-core toroidal magnets with eight coils each.
The field integral of the toroids ranges between $2.0$ and
$6.0\,\mathrm{T\kern-0.15ex m}$ across most of the detector.
The muon spectrometer includes a system of precision chambers for tracking and
fast detectors for triggering.%
''~\cite{atlas2022searches}
\end{displayquote}


\subsection{Trigger}
\label{sec:atlas_trigger}
% L1 L2 HLT
\TODO{trigger}
\begin{displayquote}
``%
A two-level trigger system is used to select events.
The first-level trigger is implemented in hardware and uses a subset of the
detector information to accept events at a rate below $100\,\mathrm{kHz}$.
This is followed by a software-based trigger that reduces the accepted event
rate to $1\,\mathrm{kHz}$ on average depending on the data-taking conditions.%

\subsection{Software}
\label{sec:atlas_software}
% how do we predict data?
\TODO{software and data?}
\begin{displayquote}
``%
An extensive software suite~\cite{ATL-SOFT-PUB-2021-001} is used in the
reconstruction and analysis of real and simulated data, in detector operations,
and in the trigger and data acquisition systems of the experiment.%
