\ldots\ But this book, by its very excellence, its thoroughness, lucidity and
precision, intensifies my growing feeling that nevertheless the theory is
arbitrary, be it however ``objective,'' and the problems it solves, however
precisely it may solve them, are not even simplified theoretical counterparts
of the real problems to which it is applied.%

To model the consequences of these many factors of uncertainty, each factor is
assigned a real-valued parameter which when varied changed the expected yields
in the hisogram bins of the search.
In this way, we form a statistical model which is a function
\begin{equation}
H_{\!f}(\vec \theta) \rightarrow (\vec \mu, \log f)
\end{equation}
from the parameters $\theta$ to Poisson expectations $\vec\mu$ the histogram
bins and a regularization term $\log f$ which is maximized in fitting.

% significancen measures
The ATLAS-recommended significance measure~\cite{atlas_significance} is
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:significance_atlas}
S_\mathrm{\atlas}(n; \mu, \sigma) =~&
\mathrm{sgn}(n - \mu) \times \sqrt{2} \\[0.2em] \nonumber
&
\times \sqrt{
n\log\left(\frac{n(\mu + \sigma^2)}{\mu^2 + n\sigma^2}\right)
- \frac{\mu^2}{\sigma^2}\log\left(
1 + \frac{\sigma^2(n - \mu)}{\mu(\mu + \sigma^2)}
\right)
}
.
\end{align}
