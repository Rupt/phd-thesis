\qitem{%
The idea that theorems follow from the postulates does not correspond to simple
observation.
If the Pythagorean theorem were found to not follow from the postulates, we
would again search for a way to alter the postulates until it was true.
Euclid's postulates came from the Pythagorean theorem, not the other way.}%

\qitem{%
One geometry can not be more true than another; it can only be more convenient.
Geometry is not true, it is advantageous.}%
