% The idea that theorems follow from the postulates does not correspond to simple
% observation.
%If the Pythagorean theorem were found to not follow from the postulates, we
%would again search for a way to alter the postulates until it was true.
Euclid's postulates came from the Pythagorean theorem, not the other way.}%

One geometry can not be more true than another; it can only be more convenient.
Geometry is not true, it is advantageous.}%
