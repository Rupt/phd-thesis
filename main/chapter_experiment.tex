\section{Calorimeters}

%% Jet / muon start of discussion sand
% Jets are `messy', right?
% Jets do tend to worse resolution --- they suffer from calorimeter noise
% (which varies with statistical properties of hadronic showers
% along with hardware effects), as well as variable
% Jets include neutral hadrons which cannot be tracked, jet clustering may
% incorrectly assign objects, and some hadrons can decay to neutrinos and soft
% muons which would go undetected, and calorimetry is inherently variable.
% This tendency, however, fails for very hard muons.
