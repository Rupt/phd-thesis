% begin with physics content and results

Our main result is the content of Figure~\ref{fig:2ljets_summary}, which shows
the data in all main regions of this analysis, along with the regions' names,
and post-fit background expectations.
This figure illustrates the background-only part of a \heplikelihood
model which is extended with signals to test alternative models.

We use two signal models in the $\twoljets$ electroweak analysis.
One is an MSSM chargino-neutralino model (C1N2) which acts to produce
$\chargino{1}\textrm{--}\neutralino{2}$ pairs which decay via $W$ and $Z$
channels respectively to jets and a lepton pair.
The other is a GMSB model which decays via Higgs and $Z$ bosons in variable
branching fractions.
Diagrams illustrating the C1N2 and GMSB signal models we consider are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:2ljets_signal_diagrams}.
Some example effects of these signals in signal regions are displayed in
Figure~\ref{fig:2ljets_signal_examples}.


At each parameter point of a signal model, it is added to the background model
and tested against data in the $\mathrm{CLs}$ prescription.
Contours showing which regions where those tests label the signal model
parameters as excluded excluded are shown for
C1N2 in Figure~\ref{fig:2ljets_contours_c1n2} and for
GMSB in~\ref{fig:2ljets_contours_gmsb}.

Data in discovery regions are presented and interpreted in
Table~\ref{tab:2ljets_discovery}.

\section{Context}
% previous results on 2(/3)L from ATLAS
% other constraints on these models from ATLAS/CMS
% previous region design, motivation for this work
Previous searches studied this two-lepton + jets + $\ptmiss$ selection
in different or smaller data-sets in \atlas.
This project serves to update those results with the full LHC Run 2 data-set,
which contains $139~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of usable proton-proton collisions at
$13~\eV[T]$ collision energy.

Increased quantity of data allows more options for this search.
Together with lessons learned from the previous searches, this is not only
an update but a chance for improvement.

This paper focusses solely on $\twoljets$ data and analyses them in the three
distinct RJR, electroweak, and strong parts.
Each part has precedent from previous searches which were conducted and
published separately with other work.
A decision was made for full Run 2 to group the searches by targetted physics,
rather than by method or targetted physical models.

The remainder of this section describes the specific history and motivations
for each of the RJR, electroweak and strong sub-projects in this search.


\subsection{RJR}
Recursive Jigsaw Reconstruction, abbreviated as RJR, is a method for
interpreting particle data as arising from user-specified decay trees.
The $\twoljets$ RJR analysis uses two C1N2 decay trees which are displayed in
Figure~\ref{fig:2ljets_rjr_decay_trees}.

\section{Event variables}
% lepton, jet definitions


\subsection{$\met$ significance}
\label{sec:metsig}
It scales $\met$ by an uncertainty derived from the resolutions of
reconstructed objects~\cite{atlas_met_significance}.

\subsection{Stranverse mass $\mttwo$}
\label{sec:mt2}
% angle between the vector sum of the lepton pair and the missing transverse momentum.
% leptons and the missing transverse momentum.
% If two massive particles are pair produced and each decays to a
% lepton and something massless and invisible,
% then this estimates a greatest lower bound on the invariant
% mass of the pair produced particles.
% $\mttwo(\ell, \ell; 0)$ is useful for excluding standard model backgrounds;
% di-leptonic ttbar ($tt\rightarrow WW\rightarrow\ell\nu\ell\nu$)
% and $WW\rightarrow\ell\nu\ell\nu$ have a kinematic endpoint
% at the $W$ pole mass, and $\tau\tau$ is constrained within measurement error of zero.

\subsection{$b$-tagging}
\label{sec:btagging}
% with $\pt > 20$ GeV,
% where the tag is taken on the mv2c10 classifier at the $77\%$ working point.

\subsection{Cheat-sheet}
Uncomfortably many event variables are used to define the regions of this
analysis.
To aid future revision of their meanings, definitions and references for these
variables are collected here.
\begin{itemize}
\item $\met$: missing transverse momentum
\item $\metsig$: object-based missing transverse momentum significance;\\
described in Section~\ref{sec:metsig}
\item $\ptjone$: transverse momentum of the hardest jet%
\vspace{0.5em}
\item $\mll$: invariant mass of the hardest two leptons
\item $\mjj$: invariant mass of the two hardest jets
\item $\mbb$: invariant mass of the two hardest b-tagged jets
\item $\mjetone$: mass of the hardest jet
\item $\mttwoll$: `stransverse` mass of the lepton pair with massless invisibles;\\
described in Section~\ref{sec:mt2}
\vspace{0.5em}
\item $\rll$: distance in $\eta\textrm{--}\phi$ between the lepton pair
\item $\rjj$: distance in $\eta\textrm{--}\phi$ between the two hardest jets%
\vspace{0.5em}
\item $n_{\mathrm{jets},30}$: number of reconstructed jets with $\pt > 30$ GeV.
\item $\nbtag$: number of b-tagged jets;
described in Section~\ref{sec:btagging}
\vspace{0.5em}
\item $\dphillmet$: azimuthal angle between the hardest jet and $\ptmiss$
\item $\Delta\phi(\mathrm{jet}_1,\met)$: azimuthal angle between
the hardest jet and $\ptmiss$
\end{itemize}
All of these are physical properties of particles or collections of particles.
Please remember that none is an exact or true value;
all are are estimates based on approximate reconstructions.
While this distinction is easy to drop in lax language, is necessary to
understand the shapes of noisy variables such as $\mjj$ and indeed the
existence of $\metsig$.

\section{Design}

The most impactful decision in a search is the design of its regions.
Like all decision in life, these designs must be made to balance conflicting
and vaguely-specified desires, and are informed with incomplete information.

This section describes the designs and rationales behind the control, validation
and signal regions of the $\twoljets$ analysis.


Splitting regions on $\metsig$ is the core idea behind the design.
The basic motivation for this design are displayed in
Figure~\ref{fig:2ljets_presel_met};
$\metsig$ does better than $\met$ in separating background and signal
contributions.
But there is more --- $\metsig$ also does a decent job of separating signal
models from each other;
signals with larger mass differences in their decays to invisibles tend to have
larger $\metsig$.
Binning regions in $\metsig$ therefore also improves sensitivity to
individual parameter points and allows targeted selections on other, locally-relevant,
event variables.

\begin{figure}[tp]

\caption{
Illustration of how $\metsig$ beats $\met$ alone in sensitivity to
example signal models.
At large $\metsig$, $t\bar t$ and other backgrounds are suppressed, leaving
quite pure diboson backgrounds and greater significance measures.
Signal models with smaller mass splittings tend to have the bulk of their
events at smaller $\met$.
\\[0.5em]
This loose selection ``SRpreewk'' requires two same-flavor opposite-sign
signal leptons with
$\mll \in (71, 111)~\eV[G]$,
$\mjj \in (60, 110)~\eV[G]$,
$\nbtag \leq 1$,
$\met > 100~\eV[G]$, and
$\metsig > 6$.
\\[0.5em]
``Significance'' displayed in the lower subplot uses the Binomial significance
$Z_{Bi}$ from~\cite{cousins2008evaluation}, with a $30\%$ background
uncertainty and yields taken to the right of a given value.
Large values indicate expected sensitivity to the signal model.
