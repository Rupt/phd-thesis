An experiment is never a failure solely because it fails to
achieve predicted results. An experiment is a failure only when it also
fails adequately to test the hypothesis in question, when the data it
produces donâ€™t prove anything one way or another.%

But there is one feature I notice that is generally missing in cargo cult
science. \ldots\
% That is the idea that we all hope you have learned in studying science in
% school--we never say explicitly what this is, but just hope that you catch
% on by all the examples of scientific investigation. It is interesting,
% therefore, to bring it out now and speak of it explicitly.
It's a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that
corresponds to a kind of utter honesty --- a kind of leaning over backwards.%

% begin with physics content and results

Our central result is Figure~\ref{fig:2ljets_summary}, which shows the names,
data, and fitted background expectations with error bars in all main regions.
This figure illustrates the background part of a \clown{likelihood}
which is extended with signals to test alternative models.
Exclusion contours testing the addition of C1N2 and GMSB signals to these
backgrounds are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:2ljets_contours_c1n2}
and~\ref{fig:2ljets_contours_gmsb}.
Interpretations of discovery region data are displayed in
Table~\ref{tab:2ljets_discovery}.

\caption{%
Data of the $\twoljets$ electroweak analysis with \emph{post-fit} backgrounds
for which the lower panel shows $S_\mathrm{ATLAS}$ from
Equation~\ref{eqn:significance_atlas}.
Control, validation and signal regions are shown from left to right, with the
regions within each category ordered approximately by their typical $\ptmiss$.
Likelihoods from validation regions are not included in the fit.
The `Top' category contains $t\bar t$ and $tW$ processes, and
`Other' contains fake/non-prompt lepton, higgs, triboson, $t\bar tZ$, and other
rare top processes.%

Left: C1N2, where the initial $\chargino{1}\textrm{--}\neutralino{2}$ pair
is produced through a $s$-channel $W^{\pm}$ resonance and the masses of
weak bosons in decays are bounded by the mass splitting
$m(\chargino{1}, \neutralino{2}) - m(\neutralino{1})$.
We explore the parameters
$m(\chargino{1}, \neutralino{2})$ and $m(\neutralino{1})$.
\\[0.5em]
Right: GMSB, where the initial $\neutralino{1}\textrm{--}\neutralino{1}$ pair
is produced by soft decays from pairs including $\chargino{1}$,
$\neutralino{2}$ or $\neutralino{1}$.
Although the $h$ and $Z$ bosons decay to many states, we target
$Z\rightarrow \ell\ell$ with
$h/Z\rightarrow bb/jj$.
We explore the parameters
$m(\neutralino{1})$ and $B(\neutralino{1} \rightarrow h \tilde{G})$ with fixed
$m(\chargino{1}, \neutralino{2}) - m(\neutralino{1}) = 1~\eV[G]$.

Contours for the C1N2 model in the $\twoljets$ electroweak analysis.
Space below the solid red line is labelled as excluded and its dotted

The yellow band shows the $\pm1$-sigma region of exclusion contours
from asymptotic approximations to the prior distribution of the test statistic.
Grey areas are observed limits from the two-lepton parts
of~\cite{SUSY-2016-24} and~\cite{SUSY-2013-11}.
Exclusion is defined by the $95\%$ $\mathrm{CLs}$ prescription
in asymptotic approximations.

\paragraph{My contributions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Design, implementation and execution of the electroweak part of the analysis.
\item Analysis Contact from January to October 2020.
\item Production of main data inputs for all three analyses
and the RJR $3\ell$ search \TODO{cite}.
I produced all systematic variations for the background samples and all
electroweak signal samples.
Other group members assisted with the central background sample.
\item Integration with ATLAS combinations and pMSSM scan efforts by
performing their validation studies and serializing the analysis results.
\item Preparation of electroweak results for publication in the paper, and the
public HEPData record~\cite{maguire2017hepdata}.
