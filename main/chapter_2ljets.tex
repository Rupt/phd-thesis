An experiment is never a failure solely because it fails to
achieve predicted results. An experiment is a failure only when it also
fails adequately to test the hypothesis in question, when the data it
produces donâ€™t prove anything one way or another.%

But there is one feature I notice that is generally missing in cargo cult
science. \ldots\
% That is the idea that we all hope you have learned in studying science in
% school--we never say explicitly what this is, but just hope that you catch
% on by all the examples of scientific investigation. It is interesting,
% therefore, to bring it out now and speak of it explicitly.
It's a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that
corresponds to a kind of utter honesty --- a kind of leaning over backwards.%
