My core contribution in this thesis is to the recent \atlas\
search ``for new phenomena in events with two leptons, jets, and
missing transverse momentum''~\cite{atlas2022searches}.
For brevity, I will call this search $\twoljets$.

There are certain plots and tables which, personally, I first seek when
meeting an \atlas\ search paper.
This chapter begins by presenting those results in brief in
Section~\ref{sec:2ljets_splash}.
The meat of this chapter (or if you prefer, its gory detail) follows in
Section~\ref{sec:2ljets_context} onwards.


\subsection{Splash summary}
\label{sec:2ljets_splash}
% begin with physics content and results


Unblinded results in all main regions of the $\twoljets$ electroweak analysis
are presented in of the Figure~\ref{fig:2ljets_summary}.
Since this figure appears to represent the data and background estimates,
on which all derived results depend, it could be seen as the keystone of this
thesis.
There are, however, caveats to be developed later in this chapter.

In a large number orthogonal signal regions, no significant excess is observed
above \emph{post-fit} backgrounds.
Indeed there are some significant deficits --- data below the background noise.

Background parts of a \heplikelihood\ model are illustrated behind data.
To test non-standard (supersymmetric) models against observation, signal
contributions are added on top of those backgrounds.

We use two signal models in the $\twoljets$ electroweak analysis.
One is an MSSM chargino-neutralino model (C1N2) which acts to produce
$\chargino_1\textrm{--}\neutralino_2$ pairs, which decay via
$W\rightarrow q\bar q$ and
$Z\rightarrow \ell^\pm \ell^\mp$ respectively..
The other is a GMSB model which, after a variety of initial states produces
$\neutralino_1\textrm{--}\neutralino_1$ pairs.
These neutralinos decay,
via Higgs and $Z$ bosons in variable branching fractions,
to final states again containing $\ell^\pm \ell^\mp$ and jet-seeding partons.
Diagrams illustrating these C1N2 and GMSB signal models are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:2ljets_signal_diagrams}.

Effects of some of these these signals in example signal regions of the
$\twoljets$ electroweak analysis are displayed in
Figure~\ref{fig:2ljets_signal_examples}.

At each parameter point of a signal model, it is added to the background model
and tested against data in the $\mathrm{CLs}$ prescription.
Contours showing which parameters of those signal models are labelled as
excluded are displayed for
C1N2 in Figure~\ref{fig:2ljets_contours_c1n2} and for
GMSB in~\ref{fig:2ljets_contours_gmsb}.

Data in discovery regions are presented and interpreted in
Table~\ref{tab:2ljets_discovery}.

\label{sec:2ljets_context}
% previous results on 2(/3)L from ATLAS
% other constraints on these models from ATLAS/CMS
% previous region design, motivation for this work
Previous analyses of \atlas\ data have explored similar selections of
two leptons, jets, and missing transverse momentum.
Quite a few analyses, in fact.
This project exists to supplement those results with information from the full
LHC Run 2 data-set which was completed in 2018 and contains
$139~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of usable proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13\,\eV[T]$.
Leverage of the increased data quantity is one key aim.
Analysis quality also might be improved if our designs can take lessons from
the experiences of previous work.

The $\twoljets$ analysis is a trinity,
of which all three parts update previously published \atlas\ results.
These three parts are named `RJR', `electroweak', and `strong', each of which
is described in its historical context in this section.

Recursive Jigsaw Reconstruction (RJR) is an algorithm for constructing useful
event variables.
The $\twoljets$ RJR analysis, detailed in Section~\ref{sec:2ljets_origins_rjr},
uses RJR variables to define its regions in a signal-independent search.

My primary contributions are to the $\twoljets$ electroweak analysis,
detailed in Section~\ref{sec:2ljets_origins_electroweak},
which uses conventional (non-RJR) event variables to define a collection of
orthogonal regions, and performs a search for effects from the electroweak
sectors of supersymmetric models.

Unsurprisingly, the strong part of the $\twoljets$ analysis is
detailed in Section~\ref{sec:2ljets_origins_strong} and
searches for effects from the strong sector.
It also uses conventional event variables, and focuses on features in the
distribution of the invariant masses of lepton pairs.

analysis.

\label{fig:2ljets_rjr_decay_trees}
\end{figure}

The Recursive Jigsaw Reconstruction (RJR) method interprets reconstructed
particle data by reconciling them with user-specified decay trees, and works
by making decisions of how to assign four-momenta to different `systems',
which are nodes of the chosen the decay graph.
Event variables are then evaluated in those systems' rest
frames~\cite{jackson2017sparticles, jackson2017rjr}.

In this way, RJR variables get some intelligence in how parent particles are
reconstructed from their visible decay products, as well as approximate
independence from uninteresting boosts, particularly those from the emission of
QCD jets outside of the supersymmetric decay tree.

Over the last several years, RJR event variables have been demonstrated to be
effective for interpreting supersymmetric particle physics
data~\cite{santoni2018probing},
and have been used in numerous \atlas\ searches~\cite{%
atlas_rjr_SUSY_2016_07,
atlas_rjr_SUSY_2016_15,
atlas_rjr_SUSY_2016_16,
atlas_rjr_23l_SUSY_2017_03,
atlas_rjr_SUSY_2018_12,
atlas_rjr_EXOT_2019_19,
atlas_rjr_3l_SUSY_2019_09
}.
They have also influenced the designs of other analyses which do not use
RJR variables themselves~\cite{atlas_rjr_mimic_SUSY_2018_06}.


Two decay trees are used in the $\twoljets$ RJR analysis, with signal region
each.
These trees target C1N2-like scenarios similar to those also considered in the
$\twoljets$ electroweak search,
and illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:2ljets_rjr_decay_trees}.

\subsubsection{Former excesses}
Excess data were observed in several signal regions of the partial Run 2
search ``for chargino--neutralino production using recursive
jigsaw reconstruction in final states with two or three charged
leptons''~\cite{atlas_rjr_23l_SUSY_2017_03},
which used $36.1~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at
$\sqrt{s} = 13\,\eV[T]$.
That search reported notable excesses in four signal regions.
Of these, two required two charged leptons
($\mathrm{SR}2\ell\_\mathrm{Low}$ and $\mathrm{SR}2\ell\_\mathrm{ISR}$),
and other two required three
($\mathrm{SR}3\ell\_\mathrm{Low}$ and $\mathrm{SR}3\ell\_\mathrm{ISR}$).

Although the largest local excess was reported as ``$3.0$ standard deviations'',
which is not particularly large, the pattern of four related regions with
excess data can understandably draw attention.

Both $\mathrm{SR}3\ell\_\mathrm{Low}$ and $\mathrm{SR}3\ell\_\mathrm{ISR}$
have been revisited with the full Run 2 data-set and updated background
modelling;
the update sees ``no significant excesses''~\cite{atlas_rjr_3l_SUSY_2019_09}.
These regions have also been approximated without direct use of RJR event
variables;
those approximations also find data ``in agreement'' with the background
model~\cite{atlas_rjr_mimic_SUSY_2018_06}.

The $\twoljets$ RJR serves to analysis reproduce
$\mathrm{SR}2\ell\_\mathrm{Low}$ and $\mathrm{SR}2\ell\_\mathrm{ISR}$,
with the full Run 2 data-set and updated background modelling,
and asks whether the excesses persist.
They do not.

\label{fig:2ljets_signal_examples}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Doubts}
Disappearing excesses have encouraged some doubts about RJR variables in
certain social circles;
the existence of the `RJR-mimic' paper~\cite{atlas_rjr_mimic_SUSY_2018_06}
is public evidence of this.

A more precisely framed problem with RJR variables is that they tend to select
phase space which is poorly modelled by simulations.
This is plausibly explained by the fact that  RJR variables are non-trivially
related to conventional, lab-frame variables.
Simulations have been tuned to model conventional variables well, and
`systematic' variations are evaluated and derived in conventional variables.
Not all functions of the data are well understood.
These effects cause Monte Carlo simulations to give predictions in RJR regions
which are inaccurate and/or carry large uncertainties.

A lack of reliable simulations motivates reliance on `data-driven' background
estimates, which, from my perspective, are hard to interpret or trust.
For these reasons, the $\twoljets$ electroweak analysis does not use any
RJR event variables.


\subsection{Electroweak}
\label{sec:2ljets_origins_electroweak}


\subsection{Strong}
\label{sec:2ljets_origins_strong}


\section{Event features}
% lepton, jet definitions

From its name, the $\twoljets$ analysis analyses features of events with two
charged leptons (electrons or muons --- not taus), and at least one jet.
Though not nominal, the a $\met$ requirement is also implicit from the context
of $R$-parity conserving supersymmetric models.
This section serves to describe how events are selected for the $\twoljets$
analyses, and which event variables are extracted for use in its selections.

Triggers and object definitions are shared between the three $\twoljets$
searches.
Higher level event variables and selections will only be described for the
$\twoljets$ electroweak search.


\subsection{Trigger}
\label{sec:2ljets_trigger}
There would be no event variables if not for the trigger.
When living our daily lives, we are bombarded with sensory data and must pay
attention only only those gems few of any use, to avoid exhausting our
processing capacity.
Running \atlas\ is no different.

Each trigger in \atlas' arsenal activates on a selection comprising some
combination of sufficiently hard objects.
The set of targeted objects includes all those used in this analysis and more:
electron, muons, jets, $b$-jets, $\met$, as well as photons and hadronically
decaying tau leptons~\cite{atlas_PERF_2007_01}.

The list of available triggers in \atlas\ is designed to balance data rates
against physical interest.
It includes a variety of general purpose selections, which are used for
$\twoljets$, along with more specialized targets such as vector boson fusion
or long lived particles.
The list varies through time, so we select triggers specifically in
each data-taking period.

The loosest triggers are `prescaled' --- their data rate is reduced by randomly
accepting only a small fraction of events.
Prescaling adds complication which we avoid;
for $\twoljets$, we use only the `lowest' (loosest, highest rate) un-prescaled
triggers selecting two charged leptons~\cite{atlas_twiki_lowest_unprescaled}.
Those charged leptons are selected in the
high-level trigger (described in Section~\ref{sec:atlas_trigger})
primarily requiring large $\pt$ and certain quality criteria which vary by
trigger.

In total, we use $14$ different two-lepton trigger selections, each of which
selects for an electron pair, a muon pair, or an emu (electron-muon pair).
To describe those triggers let $\pt^{\ell_i}$ be the transverse momentum of the
$i\mathrm{th}$ hardest lepton.

In short, all triggers require $\pt^{\ell_i}$ values to exceed thresholds in
the range $8\textrm{--}26\,\eV[G]$.
To detail all trigger requirements and their variations with data period
would be too tedious and not enlightening, but their $\pt^{\ell_i}$ requirements
are summarized here.
\begin{itemize}
\item Electron pair: requirements vary between
\begin{itemize}
\item $\pt^{e_2} > 12\,\eV[G]$ and
\item $\pt^{e_2} > 17\,\eV[G]$.
\end{itemize}
\item Muon pair: various requirements include
\begin{itemize}
\item $\pt^{\mu_2} > 10\,\eV[G]$,
\item $\pt^{\mu_2} > 14\,\eV[G]$,
\item $\pt^{\mu_1} > 18\,\eV[G]~\&~\pt^{\mu_2} > 8\,\eV[G]$, and
\item $\pt^{\mu_1} > 22\,\eV[G]~\&~\pt^{\mu_2} > 8\,\eV[G]$.
\end{itemize}
\item Emu pair: various asymmetric requirements include
\begin{itemize}
\item $\pt^{e_1} > 17\,\eV[G]~\&~\pt^{\mu_1} > 14\,\eV[G]$,
\item $\pt^{e_1} > 7\,\eV[G]~\&~\pt^{\mu_1} > 24\,\eV[G]$, and
\item $\pt^{e_1} > 26\,\eV[G]~\&~\pt^{\mu_1} > 8\,\eV[G]$.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Quite generally throughout the data used in $\twoljets$, trigger requirements
have increased in hardness with time.

\TODO{reference for trigger details, eta range?}


\subsubsection{Alternative triggers}
Why should we only use two-lepton triggers?
Alternatives could be one-lepton triggers, for cases where the other is not
reconstructed at trigger level, or perhaps also triggers for jets and $\met$.
The answer is that the benefits of additional triggers were assessed to not
outweigh the cost of using using them.

The benefit of an additional trigger could be in increased signal yields if
that trigger do not also harmfully increase inseparable backgrounds.
A study, \textit{which was performed by Knut Vadla}, investigated the effects
of of including one-lepton triggers.
In a signal-region-like selection requiring two leptons, two jets and
$\met > 200\,\eV[G]$, this study showed that two-lepton triggers already accept
in excess of $90\%$ of events from benchmark C1N2 models.
Therefore, any additional trigger has at most a $\approx10\%$;
improvement. Adding one-lepton triggers was found to increase efficiency by
only a few percentage points, depending on the model.
We considered that to be too little to be worthwhile.

Costs of triggers are attributable to human effort;
software work to include them and their associated Monte Carlo weights, along
with studies to validate background estimates and evaluate systematic
uncertainties.
Similarly, our implementation of the Matrix Method fake/non-prompt lepton
background estimate (see Section~\ref{sec:2ljets_mm_fakes}) is not equipped to
handle one-lepton triggers.

Although jet and $\met$ triggers were not studied in detail, they can be
quickly ruled out since they hard objects: examples of these triggers require
approximately $\ptjone > 400\,\eV[G]$, $p_\mathrm{T}^{\,j_3} > 200\,\eV[G]$, or
$\met > 100\,\eV[G]$~\cite{atlas_twiki_lowest_unprescaled}.
Leptons, however, are striking signals which are produced as smaller background
rates, as they suppressed by electroweak couplings.
Therefore, \atlas\ can trigger on leptons with much softer requirements;
lepton triggers allow us to use softer jets and $\met$, which are relied upon
throughout the $\twoljets$ analyses.


\subsection{Leptons}
In the context of $\twoljets$, `leptons' means `electron-or-muons';
this is because taus, which decay before reconstruction, and are not used
directly in $\twoljets$, and neutral leptons (the neutrinos) go missing.

Reconstructed lepton objects feature momenta, charges, and flavours.
Each is included only if it satisfies certain kinematic and
is identified with `quality' criteria.
For both electron and muons, these criteria are standardized with labels
`loose', `medium', and `tight'.
These are nested, in the sense that tight implies medium,
and medium implies loose.
Other, more specialized, criteria exist, but they are not relevant $\twoljets$.

Muons are identified by fitting tracks to hits in the inner tracker and muon
spectrometer.
Their quality criteria use goodness-of-fit metrics from those fits, along with
low-level details of detector interactions.
Tighter requirements primarily act to to reduce from non-prompt backgrounds,
which are muons from hadronic decays~\cite{atlas_muon_quality_MUON_2018_03}.

Electron identification combines data from the inner tracker and
calorimeters.
Electron quality criteria use numerous features of detector
interactions, track fitting metrics, the matching of tracks to calorimeter
clusters, calorimeter shower shapes, and leakage into the hadronic calorimeter.
Tighter requirements reduce backgrounds, which include misidentified objects
--- photons and hadrons --- as well as non-prompt electrons from hadronic
decays~\cite{atlas_egamma_quality_EGAM_2018_01}.

Isolation of leptons from nearby hadronic activity is another feature which
can be used to reduce misidentification rates.
Standard isolation definitions exist for both electrons and muons in a similar
structure to the quality criteria.

Leptons in $\twoljets$ are further sliced into two classes:
`baseline' and `signal'.
Baseline leptons and are used in background estimation methods and to ensure
orthogonality with other \atlas\ analyses, which study events with differing
lepton counts.
Baseline requirements are softer and lower quality than signal requirements.

Any event used in regions of the $\twoljets$ electroweak analysis is required
to have exactly two baseline leptons and exactly two signal leptons, meaning
that the event has two reconstructed leptons which pass both sets of criteria.
This vetoes events with soft or low quality third leptons, ensuring that those
three-lepton events can be used independently in other studies.

Baseline leptons are required only to have  $\pt > 3\,\eV[G]$ for muons and
$\pt > 4.5\,\eV[G]$ for electrons.
Signal leptons are all required to have $\pt > 10\,\eV[G]$, along with tighter
quality and isolation requirements, details of which are given in the
paper~\cite{atlas2022searches}.
Electrons are accepted within $|\eta| < 2.47$.
Baseline muons have $|\eta| < 2.7$, and signal muons have $|\eta| < 2.6$.


All leptons used in regions of the $\twoljets$ electroweak analysis are signal
leptons with $\pt > 25\,\eV[G]$.
This harder requirement reduces backgrounds, moves our selections away from the
lowest trigger thresholds, and matches the precedent set by previous
work~\cite{atlas_23l_SUSY_2016_24}.


\subsection{Jets}

Like leptons, hadronic jets are identified with `baseline' and `signal'
requirements with increasingly tight requirements on quality metrics and
kinematics.

Jets in $\twoljets$ use the anti-$k_t$ algorithm with the standard small-radius
parameter of $R=0.4$~\cite{jet_anti_kt}.
Jets are formed from `topological' clusters of energy deposits in the
calorimeters~\cite{atlas_jet_topo_PERF_2014_07}.

This topological clustering algorithm is no longer the \atlas-recommended jet
algorithm; it has been supplanted in recent years by a `particle flow' method,
which uses tracking information to improve the reconstruction of charged
hadrons~\cite{atlas_jet_pflow_PERF_2015_09}.
We did not attempt to switch to these improved jets because the change in
policy occurred during the years this analysis was in development, and the
change would have required more work and even more delays.

Baseline jets are defined to require $\pt > 20\,\eV[G]$ with $|\eta| < 2.8$;
signal jets additionally require $\pt > 30\,\eV[G]$.
To reduce the impact of pile-up jets, a variety of quality criteria are used,
depending on the jet $\pt$ and $|\eta|$.
Details of these quality criteria and angular selections are given in the
paper~\cite{atlas2022searches}.


\subsubsection{$b$-tagging}
\label{sec:btagging}

Tagging adds labels to objects.
For jets in $\twoljets$, $b$-tagging is used to identify jets which are
more likely to have originated from $b$ quarks;
these tags serve to improve our separation of $t\bar t$ backgrounds and
of signals producing $Z/h \rightarrow b\bar b$ decays.

Signal $b$-tagged jets require $\pt > 20\,\eV[G]$, $|\eta| < 2.5$ and a tag from
the `MV2c10' algorithm at its $77\%$ efficiency working point.
\TODO{cite, summarize}

encode information derived from data within the jet cluster.
In particular, $b$-tagging attempts to identify jets originating from $b$
quarks, which have distinct features due to the long lifetimes and decay
channels of $B$ hadrons.

\subsection{$\met$}

\subsection{$\met$ significance}
\label{sec:metsig}

Most common Standard Model processes at the LHC do not produce hard
invisible particles.
Our supersymmetric signals, however, do.
This makes the missing transverse momentum $\ptmiss$ its magnitude $\met$
important features for separating signal and background events in all parts
of the $\twoljets$ search.

The experimental resolution of $\ptmiss$, however, is imprecise.
Importantly also, the uncertainty on any inferred $\ptmiss$ varies
significantly from one event to another.

A muon, for example, will tend to have its momentum measured more precisely
than a jet of similar energy.
Unless, as discussed in Chapter~\ref{chapter:experiment}, the muon is hard
enough that its curvature through \atlas' magnetic fields is poorly tracked.
Unless, in the right circumstances, that jet originates from a $b$ quark,
such that the weak decays of its hadrons tend to lose momentum in
neutrinos or soft muons. (The $\metsig$ variable used in this analysis is not
aware of $b$-tagging information, but perhaps it could benefit from some.)

By incorporating an uncertainty in $\ptmiss$ tailored to each event, the
variable $\metsig$ helps to separate those events with real and well-measured
$\met$ from those where the measures $\ptmiss$ is more likely to result from
mismeasurements.

In the context of $\twoljets$ selections, $\metsig$ suppresses $t\bar t$
contributions more than $\met$ alone, plausibly since $t\bar t$ events are
accompanied with more hadronic activity than other sources of $\ptmiss$.
What remains of the standard model in the high-$\metsig$ tail for $\twoljets$
selections is almost pure diboson -- $ZZ$ with a hard $Z\rightarrow \nu\nu$,
and $W^\pm Z$ where the charged lepton in $W^\pm\rightarrow\ell^\pm\nu$
is not reconstructed.
\TODO{plot of diboson decomposition here?}
These effects are demonstrated from simulations in
Figure~\ref{fig:2ljets_presel_met}.

\begin{figure}[tp]

\caption{
Illustration of how $\metsig$ beats $\met$ alone in sensitivity to
example signal models.
At large $\metsig$, $t\bar t$ and other backgrounds are suppressed, leaving
quite pure diboson backgrounds and greater significance measures.
Signal models with smaller mass splittings tend to have the bulk of their
events at smaller $\met$.

}
\label{fig:2ljets_presel_met}
\end{figure}

Uncertainty in $\ptmiss$ is modelled for $\metsig$ by a covariance matrix, $S$,
in the transverse plane, and used to define
\begin{equation}
\metsig
=
\ptmiss S^{-1} \ptmiss
,
\end{equation}
which can be rearranged into a ratio of $(\met)^2$ to a function of elements
of the covariance matrix~\cite{atlas_met_significance}.
This is the square of a Mahalanobis (standard-deviations) distance between
the origin and $\ptmiss$~\cite{mahalanobis1936generalised}.

Just as $\ptmiss$ is constructed from a (negative) sum of contributions from
objects in an event,
$S$ is a sum of covariances assigned to those objects;
both means and variances add linearly.


\subsection{Stranverse mass $\mttwo$}
\label{sec:mt2}

Just as the slepton is a supersymmetric partner to a lepton, the stransverse
mass  $\mttwo$ is a partner to the `transverse mass' $m_T$
(to be defined shortly),
that is useful in searches for supersymmetric particles.

The stransverse mass of an event is a greatest lower bound on the mass of a
pair-produced resonance, that applies when each partner decays semi-invisibly.
For example, an on-shell $\tilde\ell^+\tilde\ell^-$ pair decaying as
$\tilde\ell^+ \rightarrow \ell^+ \neutralino_1
,~
\tilde\ell^- \rightarrow \ell^- \neutralino_1$ has
$\mttwo(\ell^+, \ell^-, m(\neutralino_1)) \leq m(\tilde\ell)$, plus some error
margin for experimental resolution.
Such cases are common since, R-parity conservation implies pair production,
and the idea that dark matter could comprise the lightest supersymmetric
particle motivates invisible decays.

Lacking direct observation of sleptons, $\mttwo$ remains useful in separating
standard model processes; dileptonic $t\bar t$ and $W^\pm W^\mp$ decays both
satisfy $\mttwo(\ell^+, \ell^-, 0) \leq m(W)$ (since $0 \approx m(\nu)$).
The $\twoljets$ electroweak search depends on this effect;
most selections require $\mttwo(\ell^+, \ell^-, 0) > 80\,\eV[G]$, or similar,
to reduce $t\bar t$, $W^\pm W^\mp$ and $\tau^\pm\tau^\mp$ backgrounds.

To be precise, the stransverse mass explores how to split the observed
$\ptmiss$ between the two visible decay products in an event, and can be
defined as
\begin{equation}
\mttwo(a_\mu, b_\mu, m)
=
\min_{\vec p\,+\,\vec q\,=\,\ptmiss}
\max
\begin{Bmatrix}
m_T(a_\mu + \{\!\sqrt{m^2 - \vec p_T^{\:2}},\,\vec p\,\}_\mu)\\
m_T(b_\mu + \{\!\sqrt{m^2 - \vec q_T^{\:2}},\,\vec q\,\}_\mu)\\
\end{Bmatrix}
,
\end{equation}
in which $m_T^2(p_\mu) = p_0^2 - p_1^2 - p_2^2$~\cite{lester1999measuring}.
As an extension, one can assign different masses $m_p$ and $m_q$ to the
the two invisible products~\cite{lester2015bisection}.

Numerical evaluation of $\mttwo$ can be performed efficiently with interval
bisection algorithms, which seek the least resonance mass for which the
transverse masses allow any compatible missing momentum
assignment~\cite{cheng2008minimal, lester2015bisection}.
Public code for calculating $\mttwo$ is available as a Python
library~\cite{gillam2021mt2}, to which I contributed a faster and more robust
implementation of the bisection algorithm by
Lester and Nachman~\cite{lester2015bisection} during this project.

\subsection{Cheat-sheet}
Uncomfortably many event variables are used to define the regions of this
analysis.
To aid future revision of their meanings, definitions and references for these
variables are collected here.
\begin{itemize}
\item $\met$: missing transverse momentum
\item $\metsig$: object-based missing transverse momentum significance;\\
described in Section~\ref{sec:metsig}
\item $\ptjone$: transverse momentum of the hardest jet%
\vspace{0.5em}
\item $\mll$: invariant mass of the hardest two leptons
\item $\mjj$: invariant mass of the two hardest jets
\item $\mbb$: invariant mass of the two hardest b-tagged jets
\item $\mjetone$: mass of the hardest jet
\item $\mttwoll$: `stransverse` mass of the lepton pair with massless invisibles;\\
described in Section~\ref{sec:mt2}
\vspace{0.5em}
\item $\rll$: distance in $\eta\textrm{--}\phi$ between the lepton pair
\item $\rjj$: distance in $\eta\textrm{--}\phi$ between the two hardest jets%
\vspace{0.5em}
\item $\njet$: number of signal jets
\item $\nbtag$: number of b-tagged jets;
described in Section~\ref{sec:btagging}
\vspace{0.5em}
\item $\dphillmet$: azimuthal angle between the lepton pair and $\ptmiss$
\item $\dphijmet$: azimuthal angle between the hardest jet and $\ptmiss$
\end{itemize}
All of these are physical properties of particles or collections of particles.
Please remember that none is an exact or true value;
all are are estimates based on approximate reconstructions.
While this distinction is easy to drop in lax language, is necessary to
understand the shapes of noisy variables such as $\mjj$ and indeed the
existence of $\metsig$.

\section{Design}

The most impactful decision in a search is the design of its regions.
Like all decision in life, these designs must be made to balance conflicting
and vaguely-specified desires, and are informed with incomplete information.

This section describes the designs and rationales behind the control, validation
and signal regions of the $\twoljets$ analysis.


Splitting regions on $\metsig$ is the core idea behind the design.
The basic motivation for this design are displayed in
Figure~\ref{fig:2ljets_presel_met};
$\metsig$ does better than $\met$ in separating background and signal
contributions.
But there is more --- $\metsig$ also decently separates signal models from one
another;
signals with larger mass differences in their decays to invisibles tend to have
larger $\metsig$.
Binning regions in $\metsig$ therefore also improves sensitivity to
individual parameter points and allows targeted selections on other, locally-relevant,
event variables.
