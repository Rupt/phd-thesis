An experiment is never a failure solely because it fails to
achieve predicted results. An experiment is a failure only when it also
fails adequately to test the hypothesis in question, when the data it
produces donâ€™t prove anything one way or another.%

But there is one feature I notice that is generally missing in cargo cult
science. \ldots\
% That is the idea that we all hope you have learned in studying science in
% school--we never say explicitly what this is, but just hope that you catch
% on by all the examples of scientific investigation. It is interesting,
% therefore, to bring it out now and speak of it explicitly.
It's a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that
corresponds to a kind of utter honesty --- a kind of leaning over backwards.%

% begin with physics content and results

Our main result is the content of Figure~\ref{fig:2ljets_summary}, which shows
the data in all main regions of this analysis, along with the regions' names,
and post-fit background expectations.
This figure illustrates the background-only part of a \clown{likelihood}
model which is extended with signals to test alternative models.

Diagrams illustrating the C1N2 and GMSB signal models we consider are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:2ljets_signal_diagrams}.
Some example effects of these signals in signal regions are displayed in
Figure~\ref{fig:2ljets_signal_examples}.


At each parameter point, each signal model is added to the background model
and tested against data in the $\mathrm{CLs}$ prescription.
Contours showing which regions of signal model parameters are labelled as
excluded are shown for C1N2 in Figure~\ref{fig:2ljets_contours_c1n2} and for
GMSB in~\ref{fig:2ljets_contours_gmsb}.

Data in discovery regions are presented and interpreted in
Table~\ref{tab:2ljets_discovery}.

\caption{%
Data of the $\twoljets$ electroweak analysis with \emph{post-fit} backgrounds
for which the lower panel shows $S_\mathrm{ATLAS}$ from
Equation~\ref{eqn:significance_atlas}.
Control, validation and signal regions are shown from left to right, with the
regions within each category ordered approximately by their typical $\ptmiss$.
Likelihoods from validation regions are not included in the fit.
The `Top' category contains $t\bar t$ and $tW$ processes, and
`Other' contains fake/non-prompt lepton, higgs, triboson, $t\bar tZ$, and other
rare top processes.%

Left: C1N2, where the initial $\chargino{1}\textrm{--}\neutralino{2}$ pair
is produced through a $s$-channel $W^{\pm}$ resonance and the masses of
weak bosons in decays are bounded by the mass splitting
$m(\chargino{1}, \neutralino{2}) - m(\neutralino{1})$.
We explore the parameters
$m(\chargino{1}, \neutralino{2})$ and $m(\neutralino{1})$.
\\[0.5em]
Right: GMSB, where the initial $\neutralino{1}\textrm{--}\neutralino{1}$ pair
is produced by soft decays from pairs including $\chargino{1}$,
$\neutralino{2}$ or $\neutralino{1}$.
Although the $h$ and $Z$ bosons decay to many states, we target
$Z\rightarrow \ell\ell$ with
$h/Z\rightarrow bb/jj$.
We explore the parameters
$m(\neutralino{1})$ and $B(\neutralino{1} \rightarrow h \tilde{G})$ with fixed
$m(\chargino{1}, \neutralino{2}) - m(\neutralino{1}) = 1~\eV[G]$.

\paragraph{My contributions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Design, implementation and execution of the electroweak part of the analysis.
\item Analysis Contact from January to October 2020.
\item Production of main data inputs for all three analyses
and the RJR $3\ell$ search \TODO{cite}.
I produced all systematic variations for the background samples and all
electroweak signal samples.
Other group members assisted with the central background sample.
\item Integration with ATLAS combinations and pMSSM scan efforts by
performing their validation studies and serializing the analysis results.
\item Preparation of electroweak results for publication in the paper, and the
public HEPData record~\cite{maguire2017hepdata}.
