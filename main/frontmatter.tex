\begin{abstract}
Searching for new phenomena is an essential endeavour of experimental physics,
and is helped by guidance from plausible theoretical predictions.
This thesis presents such a search for signals of high-energy protons
scattering to massive resonances, whose dramatic decays are predicted by
supersymmetric models~\cite{atlas2022searches}.

Nothing new appears in the results, so they support the Standard Model in its
continuing successful extrapolation to describe the most extreme behaviours of
proton collisions.
Supersymmetry as a concept as not falsified by this lack of new phenomena,
nor by the many similar observations.
But it is also not confirmed.

Data are best interpreted with an understanding of their origins, so we begin
by introducing the theoretical and experimental background to our search, and
the subtleties of our data-analysis procedures in their historical context.
