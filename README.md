# Two leptons, jets, and missing transverse momentum in ATLAS: yet more non-evidence for supersymmetry

My PhD thesis. Published online at https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.96552.

- Centers on my contributions to
"Searches for new phenomena in events with two leptons, jets, and missing transverse momentum
in $139\\,\mathrm{fb}^{âˆ’1}$ of $\sqrt{s} = 13\\,\mathrm{T e\kern-0.15ex V}$ $pp$ collisions with the ATLAS detector"
([EPJC](https://doi.org/10.1140/epjc/s10052-023-11434-w))
([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13072)).
- I felt thoroughly dissatisfied with the honesty and rigour of our collaboration's scientific procedures.
This thesis present various details that are not reported in the publication.

## Build this thesis

Build all versions:

```bash
make -j

```

- `main.pdf` is a draft without figures.
- `main.hard.pdf` is the hard-bound version.
- `main.soft.pdf` is the soft-bound version.
- `-j` makes all three versions in parallel.


Build the draft version only, for speed:

```bash
make draft

```
